class LanguageServerConnection( threading.Thread ):
  """
  Abstract language server communication object.

  This connection runs as a thread and is generally only used directly by
  LanguageServerCompleter, but is instantiated, started and stopped by
  concrete LanguageServerCompleter implementations.

  Implementations of this class are required to provide the following methods:
    - TryServerConnectionBlocking: Connect to the server and return when the
                                    connection is established
    - Shutdown: Close any sockets or channels prior to the thread exit
    - WriteData: Write some data to the server
    - ReadData: Read some data from the server, blocking until some data is
             available

  Threads:

  LSP is by its nature an asynchronous protocol. There are request-reply like
  requests and unsolicited notifications. Receipt of the latter is mandatory,
  so we cannot rely on there being a bottle thread executing a client request.

  So we need a message pump and dispatch thread. This is actually the
  LanguageServerConnection, which implements Thread. It's main method simply
  listens on the socket/stream and dispatches complete messages to the
  LanguageServerCompleter. It does this:

  - For requests: Using python event objects, wrapped in the Response class
  - For notifications: via a synchronized Queue.

  NOTE: Some handling is done in the dispatch thread. There are certain
  notifications which we have to handle when we get them, such as:

  - Initialization messages
  - Diagnostics

  In these cases, we allow some code to be executed inline within the dispatch
  thread, as there is no other thread guaranteed to execute. These are handled
  by callback functions and mutexes.

  Using this class in concrete LanguageServerCompleter implementations:

  Startup

  - Call Start() and AwaitServerConnection()
  - AwaitServerConnection() throws LanguageServerConnectionTimeout if the
    server fails to connect in a reasonable time.

  Shutdown

  - Call Stop() prior to shutting down the downstream server (see
    LanguageServerCompleter.ShutdownServer to do that part)
  - Call Close() to close any remaining streams. Do this in a request thread.
    DO NOT CALL THIS FROM THE DISPATCH THREAD. That is, Close() must not be
    called from a callback supplied to GetResponseAsync, or in any callback or
    method with a name like "*InPollThread". The result would be a deadlock.

  Footnote: Why does this interface exist?

  Language servers are at liberty to provide their communication interface
  over any transport. Typically, this is either stdio or a socket (though some
  servers require multiple sockets). This interface abstracts the
  implementation detail of the communication from the transport, allowing
  concrete completers to choose the right transport according to the
  downstream server (i.e. Whatever works best).

  If in doubt, use the StandardIOLanguageServerConnection as that is the
  simplest. Socket-based connections often require the server to connect back
  to us, which can lead to complexity and possibly blocking.

      that cannot be detected from the capabilities response.
    - Optionally override AdditionalLogFiles for logs other than stderr
    - Optionally override ExtraDebugItems for anything that should be in the
      /debug_info response, that isn't covered by default
    - Optionally override GetServerEnvironment if the server needs to be run
      with specific environment variables.
    - Implement the following Completer abstract methods:
      - GetServerName
      - GetCommandLine
      - SupportedFiletypes
      - DebugInfo
      - Shutdown
      - ServerIsHealthy : Return True if the server is _running_
      - StartServer : Return True if the server was started.
    - Optionally override methods to customise behavior:
      - ConvertNotificationToMessage
      - GetCompleterName
      - GetProjectDirectory
      - GetProjectRootFiles
      - GetTriggerCharacters
      - GetDefaultNotificationHandler
      - HandleNotificationInPollThread
      - Language

  Startup

  - Startup is initiated for you in OnFileReadyToParse
  - The StartServer method is only called once (reset with ServerReset)
  - See also LanguageServerConnection requirements

  Shutdown

  - Call ShutdownServer and wait for the downstream server to exit
  - Call ServerReset to clear down state
  - See also LanguageServerConnection requirements

  Completions

  - The implementation should not require any code to support completions
  - (optional) Override GetCodepointForCompletionRequest if you wish to change
    the completion position (e.g. if you want to pass the "query" to the
    server)

  Diagnostics

  - The implementation should not require any code to support diagnostics

  Sub-commands

  - The sub-commands map is bespoke to the implementation, but generally, this
    class attempts to provide all of the pieces where it can generically.
  - By default, the subcommands are detected from the server's capabilities.
    The logic for this is in DEFAULT_SUBCOMMANDS_MAP (and implemented by
    _DiscoverSubcommandSupport).
  - By default FixIt should work, but for example, jdt.ls doesn't implement
    CodeActions correctly and forces clients to handle it differently.
    For these cases, completers can override any of:
    - CodeActionLiteralToFixIt
    - CodeActionCommandToFixIt
    - CommandToFixIt
  - Other commands not covered by DEFAULT_SUBCOMMANDS_MAP are bespoke to the
    completer and should be returned by GetCustomSubcommands:
    - GetType/GetDoc are bespoke to the downstream server, though this class
      provides GetHoverResponse which is useful in this context.
      GetCustomSubcommands needs not contain GetType/GetDoc if the member
      functions implementing GetType/GetDoc are named GetType/GetDoc.
